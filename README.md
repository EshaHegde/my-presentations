## Intern/Mentor Final Presentation
This presentation was developed early in the school year as part of the Intern/Mentor course. Its purpose was to introduce my research topic, clearly outline my research question and hypothesis, and summarize the progress I had made in my research up to that point. It also served as a foundation for refining my ideas and receiving feedback to guide the next stages of my research.
