## Intern/Mentor Final Presentation
This presentation was developed during my 10th grade school year as part of my Intern/Mentor course. Its purpose was to introduce my research topic, outline my research question and hypothesis, and summarize the progress I had made in my research and internship up to that point. It served as a foundation for refining my ideas and receiving feedback to guide the next stages of my research.
